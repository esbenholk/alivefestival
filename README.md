# Rough Boilerplate
A slightly opinionated take on the Yeoman webapp generator:
- No CoffeeScript
- Base SASS styles
- Use bower.json instead of component.json

## Installation
First, make sure you have [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/) (yo), [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) and [Bower](https://github.com/twitter/bower) as they are all needed to build this project.
```
npm install -g yo grunt-cli bower
```

Second, pull this repository, `cd` into it and run the following command to install all dependancies locally into the project.
```
npm install && bower install
```
